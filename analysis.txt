While I was not able to sort through 100000 elements due do time constraints, I noticed that bubbleSort took, by far,
the most amount of time to sort in the long run. However, when dealing with a small amount of data, selectionSort is
actually slower. Additionally, if the data is already sorted, bubbleSort is much faster than selectionSort. However,
these are definitely some of the few exceptions where bubbleSort is better.
